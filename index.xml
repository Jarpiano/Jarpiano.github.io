We can refer to CVE-2023-0297 for escalation.
Initial Foothold We can enumerate open ports using nmap:
sudo nmap &amp;lt;IP&amp;gt; -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp -p- I&amp;rsquo;m using a SYN scan with these options to optimize for speed. The full range of ports is also scanned. The above command yields two ports: 22 and 50051.</description></item><item><title>Crafty Write-Up</title><link>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/crafty/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 22:05:42 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/crafty/</guid><description>Crafty (Easy) Box Overall a very fun box. Crafty is a retired box that explores a Log4j vulnerability present in a 1.16.16 Minecraft Server.
Initial Foothold Reading the description, the box has a pre-auth Log4j vulnerability. But before going into that, we should scan the ports. sudo nmap &amp;lt;IP&amp;gt; -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp -p- It looks like there are two ports open: port 80 and port 25565. Doing a quick version scan (nmap &amp;lt;IP&amp;gt; -sV -sC &amp;lt;PORT&amp;gt;) shows us that the target is running on a windows machine with a website on 80 and a Minecraft Server Version 1.</description></item><item><title>Sneaky Write-Up</title><link>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/sneaky/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 21:47:27 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/sneaky/</guid><description>Sneaky (Medium) Box Sneaky is a retired box focusing on IPv6 connections and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
Initial Foothold Enumerating through the box, we see there is an HTTP server available. Let&amp;rsquo;s fuzz this and see if we can find anything. After fuzzing, we see that there is a /dev page that leads to a login screen. We can try out some payloads
When entering a ' in the Username section, we get an Internal Server Error.</description></item><item><title>Beep Write-Up</title><link>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/beep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 15:59:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/beep/</guid><description>Beep (Easy) Write-Up - HTB Beep is a retired machine released back in 2017. Upon preview, the description doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give us a lot.
Initial Foothold We can enumerate through the website using a tool like ffuf or gobuster. Using either, we&amp;rsquo;re able to map out the website. At face value though, there isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot we can find. Let&amp;rsquo;s view it with a browser. When using a browser, we get some issues viewing the site due to SSL configurations.</description></item><item><title>Websites</title><link>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/websites/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:28:58 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/websites/</guid><description>Habitat For Humanity THS A website for the Habitat For Humanity Travis Chapter - made during my time as officer.

Try looking into the browser dev tools and for a variable named score. From the hint, we assume that we start at the source of the page. When we look into the HTML for the game pop-up, we can find a script tag with some JavaScript. Based on the hint, we should try looking for the variable score.</description></item><item><title>Reviewing Cyberstart America</title><link>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/reviewingcyberstart/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 17:38:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/reviewingcyberstart/</guid><description>Anecdote It was January of 2021. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t get cold where I come from, but this year started off chilly. I remember the countless times I would sit on my computer, open up a VM, and take a sip of hot cocoa. Those were my first memories of CyberStart America: comfort, nostalgia, and warmth.
Intro Originally a program solely for women in STEM, CyberStart America was soon established around 3-4 years ago.</description></item><item><title>2024 Tech Thoughts</title><link>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/predictions2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 16:45:47 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jarpiano.github.io/blog/predictions2024/</guid><description>Looking Back A lot of things happened in 2023. Just to name a few are:
The Rise and (expected) Fall of NFTs. Crypto&amp;rsquo;s continuous plummet down. Improvements in AI, pioneered by ChatGPT in general chatbot services, MidJourney in generative images, etc. A dozen more Javascript frameworks More tech layoffs And, of course, inflation But, hey&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s a new year. So let&amp;rsquo;s set some expectations at least. These are just my random tech predictions for 2024 which may or may not be supported by actual data.</description></item><item><title>Competing in CyberStart America</title><link>https://jarpiano.github.io/blueprint/ncsf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 14:46:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jarpiano.github.io/blueprint/ncsf/</guid><description>Cyber Journey CyberStart America is the most enjoyable way to discover your talent, advance your skills and win scholarships in cybersecurity! - CyberStart America
