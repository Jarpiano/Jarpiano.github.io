## Looking Back
*A lot* of things happened in 2023. Just to name a few are:
- The Rise and (expected) Fall of NFTs.
- Crypto's continuous plummet down.
- Improvements in AI, pioneered by ChatGPT in general chatbot services, MidJourney in generative images, etc.
- A dozen more Javascript frameworks
- More tech layoffs
- And, of course, **inflation**

But, hey... It's a new year. So let's set some expectations at least. These are just my random tech predictions for 2024 which **may or may not be supported by actual data**. Take from it what you will, or ignore it completely! Now, let's brain dump.

## Expect More AI
AI had an incredible year in 2023, but don't its streak to end anytime soon. In 2024, ChatGPT is only gonna grow increasingly more powerful. Based on last year alone, we can expect that we'll likely find a GPT-5 or 5.5. Maybe, ChatGPT would be able to process more data per prompt its given, answer complex physics problems correctly, or give more neutral responses rid of the biases that'd usually accompany typical AI models. Things could even go in the opposite direction. Maybe GPT would become *more* bias, especially if the developers decide to process all of the posts from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en). In whatever direction the wind blows, it's certain though that ChatGPT will improve in some way. *How* you ask? I honestly have no clue. To be fair, I still haven't used the platform. But if I had to guess, ChatGPT would probably be able to consider the context between an image, video, and text.

MidJourney and its other generative AI counterparts also show a lot of promise. If you compare image generation ten years ago to the current, the difference is astonishing. We can expect 2024 to have more realistic, less formulaic media, especially in humans. We'll also cross the realm over to video generation where a single prompt could produce short feature films at unbelievable picture quality (I can't vouch for the plot though). Video manipulation is also expected and we'd eventually be able to seamlessly integrate reality with AI generated video content. Many already have these ideas on their mind and some have moved forward with them. Only time will tell whether this will come true this year.

## More languages... More Frameworks
Developers will never catch a break. Newer technologies are being made and that comes at the added cost of educating our labor force. Bun, for example, is a new Javascript Framework released last 2023 that became more popular recently. Though I'm not here to diss on Bun, it's clear that there are **too many** Javascript frameworks and libraries out there, and I can only expect that more will be awaiting us coming late 2024.

## Semiconductor Shortage Ending 
These past few years have come with increased prices for Raspberry Pi(s), Arduinos, and other single board suppliers as the semiconductor shortage continued. Hopefully, by 2024, the shortage would have passed and we'd have fairly price, affordable tech again for hobbyists and enthusiasts once more. Don't get too excited though. Nobody expected the shortage to last **this** long, but let's hope that it finally ends.

## Tech Layoffs... Again
After I thought we'd finally have job security, big tech companies once again had layoffs. In the first few days of January alone, Google, Amazon, and Discord laid off thousands of their workers. But, maybe this is a sign. It's high time we consider small companies and startups as compared to the corporate giants of the tech world.

## AR and VR Improvements
It's been quite a while since I've heard success in this department. The fall of the Metaverse was likely a threatening warning to those who even considered going back to this field, but I can see a return to it this year. Specifically, rather than the social media platform people thought VR could serve as, maybe it could instead deal with more pressing problems such as accessibility. Don't have a car but need to learn how to drive? Try it out first in VR. Need a "scenery" of the beach, mountains, or lake? Try VR. These are just some of the things I hope to see moving forward.

## Final Thoughts
Most of this is speculation or just wishful thinking so consider it with a grain of salt. Of course, if you shared my thinking or felt some change by it, just know that there's another person out there who thinks the same. Once again, these are my "predictions" for what we'll see for 2024, but there's still so much more to expect when it's still January. Keep on searching.
