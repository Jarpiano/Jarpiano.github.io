## Anecdote
It was January of 2021. It doesn't get cold where I come from, but this year started off chilly. I remember the countless times I would sit on my computer, open up a VM, and take a sip of hot cocoa. Those were my first memories of CyberStart America: comfort, nostalgia, and warmth.

## Intro
Originally a program solely for women in STEM, CyberStart America was soon established around 3-4 years ago. I believe, that during that time, James Lyne(?), an influential figurehead of the program, once said that the goal of the program was to accomplish the goal of getting +25,000 students into cybersecurity by 2025. Did they achieve this goal? *Probably.* As one of the senior students, I'm certain, however, that CyberStart America accomplished its other goal— to inspire the next generation of cybersecurity and software students.

## Review
CyberStart approached the cybersecurity professional shortage in the best possible why— free education. It's bases covered all topics of cybersecurity including programming, traditional concepts (injection, intrusion, etc), and digital forensics. This was a lesson. Having a platform for practical learning available at any time was convenient and engaging.

It was an honor to have the opportunity to participate in the CyberStart America program. Although I will miss the program (as will many) as it closes this year, I'm also grateful that there was such a program offering opportunities to began with. It was my pleasure.
