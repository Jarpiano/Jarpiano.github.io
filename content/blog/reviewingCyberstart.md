## Anecdote
CyberStart was one of the few opportunities available for high schoolers that put a focus more on learning rather than competition (it had both though). What made it different from programs such as HackTheBox were the chances to get a certification at the end of yearly program, with some criteria completed of course. From what I can recall, courses and exam attempts for at minimum the GSEC, GFACT, GCIH, and a cloud certification that I can't remember were available. 

The program's mission was to get around 25,000 students into cyber security by 2025. It was started by several individuals partnered SANS institute, with James Lyne prominently leading the first year's cohort. 

It was an honor to have the opportunity to participate in the CyberStart America program. I will definitely miss the program as it closes this year.
