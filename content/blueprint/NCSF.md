## Cyber Journey
>CyberStart America is the most enjoyable way to discover your talent, advance your skills and win scholarships in cybersecurity! - [CyberStart America](https://www.cyberstartamerica.org/)

For this competition, I was titled [National Cyber Scholarship Scholar with Honors](https://api.badgr.io/public/assertions/-t0yxooXRribOcXAIC_fGA) in 2023 and awarded $9,000 worth of course material. During this period, I solved all but one challenge and accumulated 140,000+ points to earn the [CyberStart America Gold Award](https://api.badgr.io/public/assertions/176AfSMPRwCP8fHVzkojSQ).

Prior to this award, I had competed in the competition before and was titled **NCSF Finalist** and given the CA Gold Award, each respectively twice. 

CyberStart allowed me to learn different skills such as *binary exploitation*, *SQL injection*, *python and bash programming*, *forensic security* and a lot more.
